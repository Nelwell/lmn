Keep notes on the tasks you worked on for Project 5. This worksheet will be used to assess your teamwork and individual contributions to the project. It will be used to help give credit for tasks for which there may not be direct evidence in the code, for example, helping others, research, troubleshooting.

Met with team. We all collaborated on ideas and who was doing what. We all set up our timeline. Then we all made sure we had our projects we were working on set up properly. Meaning we made sure everyone related to GitHub and the project environment was set up. 


Week beginning Monday April 12th
We met with our team on Sunday. We worked together to solve issues we had with some of the branches that had been created and then we merged them with our main. We all brain stormed ideas about what we were going to do. I set up bootstrap within our Django app. I have been working on the CSS and HTML parts of the web page. Ran in to a snag with the CSS not applying to my page.  I am going to troubleshoot and make it work.

We all met again at our planed Sunday meeting time. The meeting went well we all talked and discussed how we want to page to look. We discussed what parts of the project we still need to do and prioritize. We then looked at pull requests and issues we had with some of the new features we worked on.
